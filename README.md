# startpage
## A simple page with some bookmarks and a calculator for manual financial forecast

This was originally a learning project to mess around with pure HTML and CSS and it eventually grew into a daily startpage I use to organise my most frequently visited websites.

Feel free to fork, copy and use it as a template (note: templates have not been setup properly via github).
